Writing a thesis always involves a lot of working, fighting against adversity and enduring numerous obstacles. This one is no exception, and it wouldn’t have been finished without the help of my two directors José Manuel Prats Montalbán and Agustín Lahoz Rodríguez. 

I want to thank also the help and insights given by Alberto Ferrer Riquelme, who has greatly contributed with his knowledge to the contents of this work.

Special thanks to Victoria Fornés Ferrer for her help with the valencian version of the abstract and for being such a great colleage.

Finally, some lines to my parents Ana and Tomás, my brother Raúl, my wife Lucía and my precious daughter Laura. Thank you for your support, for your patience and your love. This thesis is dedicated to you all.
